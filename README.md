# Genealogical Tree

This repository demonstrates working with JavaFX to create a nice user interface for a small program. In my case, this is a program with the theme of the Family Tree.
Each user form was made in a specific scene. For each scene, a code is written that allows the user to interact with the program without any problems.
The data entered in this program is stored in a file and displayed in the program, with the possibility of changing, adding or deleting them.
